Whiteboard (archived)

This is my hobby project. In this I am using modified version of [wwwsqldesigner(v1.6)](http://code.google.com/p/wwwsqldesigner/) of ondrej.zara.

I have written this application as I wanted to learn and experiment with Node.JS, socket.io and mongodb.

You can see demo of this <a href="https://whiteboard-bharat.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
- You will be prompted for Whiteboard name (remember this) and your name
- In other browser window open the same link and use the same Whiteboard name from previous step and another user name.

There are many modifications in wwwsqldesigner.js file. I will update them shortly.
